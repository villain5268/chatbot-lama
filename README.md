Project Overview
This project is a simple chatbot application built using React.js for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and integrated with the Groq Llama model for intelligent single-question responses. The chatbot allows users to ask one question at a time, leveraging the power of the Llama model for natural language processing.

Features
Single Question Answering: Users can input one question at a time and receive precise answers.
Frontend: React.js-based responsive interface.
Backend: Spring Boot REST API for handling requests.
AI Integration: Groq Llama model for processing and generating responses.
Seamless Integration: Smooth communication between frontend and backend via REST APIs.
Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
AI Model: Groq Llama Model
Communication: RESTful APIs
Build Tools: Maven (Spring Boot), npm/yarn (React.js)
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Java 17 or later
Node.js and npm/yarn
Maven
Docker (for running the Groq Llama Model, if required)
Git
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-llama.git
cd chatbot-llama
2. Backend (Spring Boot) Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend
Configure the application.properties file:

Update the configuration for any required database or external services. This project doesn't require a database but may need configurations for the Groq Llama model endpoint.

Build the Spring Boot application:

mvn clean install
Run the application:

mvn spring-boot:run
The backend will start on http://localhost:8080.

3. Frontend (React.js) Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd ../frontend
Install dependencies:

npm install
Start the React application:

npm start
The frontend will start on http://localhost:3000.


Usage
Open the React app at http://localhost:3000.
Enter a question in the chatbot interface.
The backend processes the request using the Groq Llama model and returns the response.
The response is displayed in the chat interface.
Future Enhancements
Add multi-turn conversation support.
Improve UI/UX design.
Integrate with other Llama model features.
Add authentication and user sessions.
